# Goal

The goal of the project is to create an image-filtering tool that follows the same concept as the 
Focal  Statistics  from  ArcGIS. This tool iterates through every cell of the input raster and calculates a statistic of the values that surround it. These surrounding values are determined by different so called neighborhoods. The neighborhoods we will implement are *Square*, *Rectangle*, *Circle* and *Wedge* (see figure \ref{fig:windows}), available statistics will be *minimum*, *maximum*, *mean*, *standard deviation* and *variance*.


# Methods and challenges

The project is programmed in base Python with the addition of the packages *numpy* and *matplotlib*. We tried to stay close to the ArcGIS implementation of focal statistics. The exact implementation can be found here: [ArcGis' Focal Statistics](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/how-focal-statistics-works.htm). The main challenges were the implementation of the different neighborhoods and the question how to deal with the problem that arises when the processed cell is close to the edge of the raster and the neighborhood window would reach outside of the boundary.

## The Neighborhood types

**Square:** The square has the same height as width. When they are odd, a central pixel in the middle of the square can be determined. When they are even, the middle is between two pixels. Here, the center is assigned to the left respectively the top one of the possible central pixels.

**Rectangle:** The rectangular window has different heights and widths, but is similar to the square otherwise. See figure \ref{fig:windows}a for an example with even height and width.


**Circle:** The neighborhood window is defined by a circle around the processed cell. The radius is determined by user input. Any cell whose center falls inside the specified radius is included in the window (see \ref{fig:windows}b).



**Wedge:** Similar to the *Circle* neighborhood, the user defines a radius that determines the cells included in the window. But instead of a full 360° circle, the user chooses a start and end angle determining the segment of the circle that makes up the neighborhood window. The wedge spans counterclockwise from the start to the end angle, which must be given in degrees from 0° to 360°, the positive x-axis being 0° (see \ref{fig:windows}c).

(b): Circle Neighborhood, radius of 3 pixels. (c): Wedge Neighborhood, radius of 3 pixels, start angle 0°, end angle 135°. \label{fig:windows}](figures/windows.png)


## The edge problem

Due to division of labor, we have two different approaches for dealing with the edge problem. The first one is applied in the *Square* and *Rectangle* neighborhood and categorizes cells in normal and edge cases. For the *Circle* and *Wedge*, we use padding. 

For the *Square* and the *Rectangle* neighborhood, we use two functions: *rectangfun* and *get_newdata*. The first determines the number of pixels from the central pixel to all four sides. This depends on whether the height and width of the window is even or odd. Is the width even, the central pixel is assigned to the left pixel of the two possible middle pixels. For an even height, the central pixel is the top pixel.

Now, *get_newdata* uses the information about the window size in order to calculate the output data. For the argument *ignore_nodata* equals true, it categorizes the data into normal case and edge and corner cases, where the neighborhood shape would be bigger than the data frame. Here, it shrinks the neighborhood to the available pixels in the neighborhood. A code example using the upper left corner:


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
for col in range(np.size(data, 1)):
            for row in range(np.size(data, 0)):
                
                # all corners:
                if col < wsize_left and row < wsize_top: # topleft
                    window = data[:row+wsize_bot+1, :col+wsize_right+1]
```

Here, the code iterates through all pixels in the matrix, searching for those, whose neighborhood is reaching out of the edges of the matrix. In *col < wsize_left*, it is checked if the column of the pixel is smaller than the left window size of the neighborhood. If this is the case, as well as the row number of the pixel is smaller than the top window size, the code calculates the window for the upper left case.  
The data gets sliced. From the very top of the matrix until the bottom edge of the neighborhood the rows get addressed. For the columns, the slice goes from the very left of the matrix until the right edge of the neighborhood.  

In all cases, the statistical function is applied to the neighborhood window and the result is stored in a new data frame. If there is an NA value in the data frame, the calculation is made with the remaining.  
Is *ignore_nodata* equals false, all pixels whose neighborhoods extend beyond the edges, are set to NA values. Besides, all pixels with NA values in their neighborhood get also NA values.
The code for the rectangle approach uses base Python and numpy.

In the case of the *Circle* and *Wedge* neighborhood, the main function *focal_statistics* iterates through all input raster cells and collects all cell values that fall in the neighborhood window with the help of the function *get_values*. It then applies the specified statistic to these values and returns the result as the updated cell value.  
The first step however, is to  pad the input raster with a number of rows and columns. This number depends on the radius the user determines and ensures that the window around a cell close to the edge of the input raster never extends past the boundary of the padded raster. The cells of the padding are filled with *NA* values and hence the *ignore_nodata* argument defines how the edge cells will be filled. When *ignore_nodata* is set to *true* (the default), the statistic will be applied to all the values of the window that are not *NA*, when it is set to *false* the cell will be replaced by *NA*, effectively reducing the size of the output raster.  
Once the padding is set up, the algorithm iterates through the input raster. The function *get_values* then returns all values of the cells that fall into the neighborhood window of the currently processed cell. It does so by calculating the distance (from center to center) from the processing cell to all other cells. With this information and the radius the *Circle* neighborhood can be determined. For the *Wedge* neighborhood, additionally, the angle from the processing cell to all other cells has to be calculated (with the function *get_angle*). Now, together with the specified start and end angle, the neighborhood window can be determined.

# Result

The following figures show the resulting output rasters for three different types of neighborhoods (figure \ref{fig:rec} = rectangle, figure \ref{fig:circle} = circle and figure \ref{fig:wedge} = wedge) and statistics ((a) = *mean*, (b) = *max* and (c) = *standard deviation*). The input raster has always been the same and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:input}.
