# Interacting with the remote repository
# --------------

## Whenever you want to get the changes other collaborators have pushed to the original repo:
git pull

## Whenever you want to push the changes you have done locally to the original repo:
git push


# Tracking changes in your local working copy
# ---------------

## To check the status of your working copy
git status

## Anything that shows up red, are files that have been changed and are not ready to commit yet,
## anything in green are files that are ready to commit.

## To make files ready to commit:
git add filename1 filename2    # multiple files
git add * 		       # all files

## To commit files:
git commit -m 'commit message'  # -m stands for message and means that the text  in between '' is used as the commit message.
